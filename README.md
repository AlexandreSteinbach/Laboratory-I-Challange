# Laboratory-I-Challange

This is a challenge created for the Laboratory I course at Unisinos University. It showcases some basic Java coding.

Note: The code is written in Brazilian Portuguese, as required by the course.

The project is divided into four steps, each covering a different core concept in object-oriented programming:
  Class Creation – Introduction to creating classes and basic object structure.
  Class Association – Demonstrates how classes interact with each other.
  Inheritance and Polymorphism – Applies core OOP principles to extend functionality.
  Arrays – Uses arrays to handle and organize multiple objects.

This was the first project where I applied all the foundational concepts in a single cohesive codebase.
If you’d like to leave a constructive comment or a few words of encouragement, I’d really appreciate it!

Thanks for checking it out!
